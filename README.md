This library was first written and used internally at
[Tech in Asia](https://github.com/techinasia). It was also tested extensively
with the help of my team mates at the time, [Ong Kwong How](https://github.com/kwonghow), [Melvin Lee](https://github.com/zyml), and [Chee Aun](https://github.com/cheeaun), from whom I have learned much.
